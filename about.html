  My name is Fahmo Gedi and I am a Pharmacology undergraduate at Southampton University. Having moved from London myself, I know that I would have personally felt more at ease settling into Southampton if I could just get a glimpse into another student at Southamptons experience and how they found their first few weeks. The aim of Experience is to provide a platform where individual stories and experiences since coming to Southampton University can be exchanged. New students will benefit greatly from hearing others familiarities, especially if they are moving from abroad, or did not initially live in Southampton, I know I would! I Hope you find this page helpful, get exploring! If you go back to the home page and click on the menu bar, you can start to read a few students experiences and places they suggest in Southampton. Where links can be made, they will be presented. More than anything I hope this website is of much help.  </p>
